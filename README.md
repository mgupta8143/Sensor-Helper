# Sensor-Helper
Normally, when I go into my house, there is a sensor on the side that is activated and often I forget to turn it off because it never gives some sort of alert saying the alarm has been activated.
I understand why the creators of the sensor would do this, but sometimes I honestly just need to have some cue because when it turns on, my dad has to send the a message to the alarm people that
it was a false alarm. 

For that reason, I decided to built "Sensor Helper" (not an original name at all, but who cares) which is basically a small device that plays a tone upon passing it. The idea is that
before I leave my house, I can turn on the device (will activate 60 seconds after turning on), I can leave my house, and then when I come back (and forget to turn off the alarm again), 
it basically makes a sound as I pass it, so I can quickly go back and turn off the alarm.

Possible Improvements:
- Better Wiring (its so tangled)
- Connect it to storage and log data and make some visualizations out of it using Python
- Bluetooth compatibility to use it on an app
- Better Sound Effects
